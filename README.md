# Rust Task Manager

This is a simple project built with Rust, it is a fullstack app that utilizes only Rust (Slint for UI) and aims to be deployed on several platforms.

## Slint

I wish to learn Rust, especially to see if the UI tools are mature and easy to use. 

## More to come...

This README is a bit barebones, but don't worry! As the project moves along it will be expanded upon.
